# UDFT: Unitary Discrete Fourier Transform (and related)

![licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/forieux/udft) ![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/udft) ![status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/udft) ![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/udft)

This module implements unitary discrete Fourier transform, that is orthonormal.
This module existed before the introduction of the `norm="ortho"` keyword and is
now a very (very) thin wrapper around Numpy or pyFFTW (maybe others in the
future), mainly done for my personal usage. There is also functions related to
Fourier and convolution like `ir2fr`.

It is useful for convolution [1]: they respect the Perceval equality, e.g., the
value of the null frequency is equal to `1/√N * ∑ₙ xₙ`.

## Installation and documentation

UDFT is just the file `udft.py` and depends on `numpy` and Python 3.7 only. I
recommend using poetry for installation

```
   poetry add udft
```
or
```
   poetry add udft[fftw]
```
to install the pyFFTW also (recommended), but the package is available with pip
also. For a quick and dirty installation, just copy the `udft.py` file: it is
quite stable, follow the [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), and major changes are
unlikely.
